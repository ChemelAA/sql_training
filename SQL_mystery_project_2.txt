1) Initial clues: crime = murder, date = Jan.15, 2018, place = SQL City.
    
    --We can extract description for this crime from 'crime_scene_report' table:
    
    SELECT description 
    FROM crime_scene_report 
    WHERE type = "murder" AND date = 20180115 AND city = "SQL City"
    
    --Result:
    
    "Security footage shows that there were 2 witnesses. The first witness lives 
    at the last house on ""Northwestern Dr"". The second witness, named Annabel, 
    lives somewhere on ""Franklin Ave""."
    
    
2) We go to the 'person' table for these two witnesses:

    --First witnesses lives the last house on ""Northwestern Dr"":
    
    SELECT * 
    FROM person 
    WHERE address_street_name = "Northwestern Dr"
    ORDER BY address_number desc
    LIMIT 1
    
    --It is:
    14887	Morty Schapiro	118009	4919	"Northwestern Dr"	111564949
    
    --Second witnesses lives on "Franklin Ave" and has name Annabel
    
    SELECT * 
    FROM person 
    WHERE address_street_name = "Franklin Ave" AND name LIKE "Annabel%"
    
    --It is:
    16371	Annabel Miller	490173	103	      "Franklin Ave"	318771143
    
3) We have IDs, driver licenses and SSN of witnesses

    --Lets check if they have been interviewed using 'interview' table:
    
    SELECT transcript
    FROM interview 
    WHERE person_id IN (14887, 16371)
    
    --Now we have two interview transcripts:
    
    "I heard a gunshot and then saw a man run out. He had a ""Get Fit Now Gym"" 
    bag. The membership number on the bag started with ""48Z"". Only gold members 
    have those bags. The man got into a car with a plate that included ""H42W""."
    
    I saw the murder happen, and I recognized the killer from my gym when I was 
    working out last week on January the 9th.
    
4) We now know that the killer is connected with "Get Fit Now Gym". He/She is a 
    gold member with membership number starts with "48Z" and with a car that has
    "H42W" in a number. Also, killer was in the gym on January the 9th.
    
    --Lets check the gym database for the mentioned person:
    
    SELECT * 
    FROM get_fit_now_member
    WHERE id LIKE "48Z%" AND membership_status = "gold"
    
    --We have tho people:
    "48Z7A"	"28819"	"Joe Germuska"	"20160305"	"gold"
    "48Z55"	"67318"	"Jeremy Bowers"	"20160101"	"gold"
    
    --Explore also gym check-in database:
    
    SELECT * 
    FROM get_fit_now_check_in 
    WHERE check_in_date = 20180109 AND membership_id like "48Z%"
    
    --Also two records - both of them were in gym that day:
    "48Z7A"	"20180109"	"1600"	"1730"
    "48Z55"	"20180109"	"1530"	"1700"
    
    --Checking killer's car number:
    
    SELECT * 
    FROM drivers_license 
    where plate_number like "%H42W%"
    
    --We have 3 cars:
    "183779"	"21"	"65"	"blue"	"blonde"	"female"	"H42W0X"	"Toyota"	"Prius"
    "423327"	"30"	"70"	"brown"	"brown"	    "male"	    "0H42W2"	"Chevrolet"	"Spark LS"
    "664760"	"21"	"71"	"black"	"black"	    "male"	    "4H42WR"	"Nissan"	"Altima"
    
    --First witness said "I saw a man run out", so we can leave only males
    "423327"	"30"	"70"	"brown"	"brown"	    "male"	    "0H42W2"	"Chevrolet"	"Spark LS"
    "664760"	"21"	"71"	"black"	"black"	    "male"	    "4H42WR"	"Nissan"	"Altima"
    
5) Now we have two driver license IDs for two drivers from the previous result:
    423327 and 664760
    
    --We can check them in 'person' table:
    
    SELECT * 
    FROM person 
    wHERE license_id IN (423327, 664760)
    
    --Result:
    "51739"	"Tushar Chandra"	"664760"	"312"	"Phi St"	            "137882671"
    "67318"	"Jeremy Bowers"	    "423327"	"530"	"Washington Pl, Apt 3A"	"871539279"
    
    --One of them shoulb be a gold member of the gym:
    SELECT * 
    FROM get_fit_now_member 
    where person_id in (SELECT id 
        FROM person 
        wHERE license_id IN (423327, 664760))
        
    --Result:
    48Z55	67318	"Jeremy Bowers"	20160101	gold
    
6) So now our circle of suspects has narrowed down to only ONE person. Its time 
    to check if "Jeremy Bowers" is the killer using the insertion trigger in the 
    'solution' table:
    
    INSERT INTO solution VALUES (1, "Jeremy Bowers");
    SELECT * from solution;
    
    --We will get:
    "Congrats, you found the murderer! But wait, there's more... If you think 
    you're up for a challenge, try querying the interview transcript of the 
    murderer to find the real villain behind this crime. If you feel especially 
    confident in your SQL skills, try to complete this final step with no more 
    than 2 queries. Use this same INSERT statement with your new suspect to 
    check your answer."

    --So, we need to check the killer's interview transcript:
    
    SELECT transcript
    FROM interview
    WHERE person_id = 67318;
    
    --What we will get:
    "I was hired by a woman with a lot of money. I don't know her name but I 
    know she's around 5'5"" (65"") or 5'7"" (67""). She has red hair and she 
    drives a Tesla Model S. I know that she attended the SQL Symphony Concert 
    3 times in December 2017."
    
    --We were asked to find killer with no more than two queries, so we need to
    use only one last query. We will use 3 tables at once: 'drivers_license',
    'person' and 'facebook_event_checkin'. We also have the following clues:
    Hair: red
    Gender: female
    Car: Tesla Model S
    Event: SQL Symphony Concert (3 times)
    Date: December 2017
    
    --The final query:
    
    SELECT p.name, count(*)
    FROM person as p
    join drivers_license as dl
    on p.license_id = dl.id
    join facebook_event_checkin as fb
    on p.id = fb.person_id
    where dl.car_make = "Tesla" AND dl.car_model = "Model S" AND dl.gender = "female" 
    AND dl.hair_color = "red" AND fb.event_name = "SQL Symphony Concert"
    AND fb.date LIKE "201712%"
    group by p.name
    
    --As a result, we really have one person who meets all conditions and she
    really was at SQL Symphony Concert 3 times in Dec 2017, namely, on 6, 12 and 29
    of December:
    "Miranda Priestly"	3
    
7) Lets check her for being a killer:

    INSERT INTO solution VALUES (1, "Miranda Priestly");
    SELECT * from solution;
    
    --Result:
    
    "Congrats, you found the brains behind the murder! Everyone in SQL City 
    hails you as the greatest SQL detective of all time. Time to break out the 
    champagne!"
    
    
    THE END
